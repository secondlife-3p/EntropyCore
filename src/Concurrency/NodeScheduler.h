/**
 * @brief Manages graph node scheduling and overflow handling for work execution
 * 
 * NodeScheduler serves as the interface between WorkGraph's high-level dependency
 * management and WorkContractGroup's low-level execution system. When WorkGraph
 * determines nodes are ready for execution, this scheduler manages their transition
 * into the work queue. The scheduler handles capacity constraints by maintaining a
 * deferred queue for nodes that cannot be immediately scheduled due to queue limitations.
 * 
 * This component bridges the abstraction gap between graph-based task management and
 * queue-based execution. It addresses the practical constraint that ready nodes may
 * exceed available execution slots, providing buffering and advanced scheduling
 * infrastructure.
 * 
 * Key responsibilities:
 * - Immediate scheduling when there's capacity
 * - Deferred queue management when work queue is full
 * - Batch scheduling (schedule multiple nodes in one go)
 * - Lifecycle callbacks for monitoring and debugging
 * - Statistics tracking for analysis
 * 
 * Complexity characteristics:
 * - Deferred queue operations: O(1) push_back, O(1) pop_front
 * 
 * Suitable applications:
 * - Task graphs that might generate bursts of ready nodes
 * - Systems where work generation can outpace execution
 * - Monitoring node execution lifecycle for debugging
 * - Building priority scheduling on top (future enhancement)
 * 
 * Design trade-offs:
 * - Uses mutex for thread safety (not lock-free like WorkContractGroup)
 * - Deque for deferred queue (good cache locality, no allocations until overflow)
 * - Separate stats tracking to avoid polluting hot path
 *
