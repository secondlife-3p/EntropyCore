/**
 * @brief Thread pool service that executes work contracts from multiple groups.
 *
 * Think of WorkService as a team of workers (threads) that grab tasks from different
 * departments (WorkContractGroups). Each department has its own queue of work, and
 * the workers use a pluggable scheduler to decide which department needs help most.
 *
 * The service delegates all scheduling decisions to an IWorkScheduler implementation,
 * allowing you to experiment with different scheduling strategies without modifying
 * the core thread management logic.
 *
 * Perfect for:
 * - Game engines that need to balance rendering, physics, AI, and audio work
 * - Servers that handle different types of requests with varying priorities
 * - Any system with multiple independent work producers that need fair execution
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Lock-free work execution (groups handle their own synchronization)
 * - Pluggable scheduling strategies via IWorkScheduler interface
 * - Thread pool management independent of scheduling logic
 * - No work stealing between groups (intentional for data isolation)
 *
 * @code
 * // Create service with adaptive ranking scheduler (default)
 * WorkService::Config config;
 * config.threadCount = 8;
 * WorkService service(config);
 *
 * // Or use a custom scheduler
 * auto scheduler = std::make_unique<RoundRobinScheduler>(schedulerConfig);
 * WorkService service(config, std::move(scheduler));
 *
 * // Add work groups from different systems
 * service.addWorkContractGroup(&renderingGroup);
 * service.addWorkContractGroup(&physicsGroup);
 * service.addWorkContractGroup(&audioGroup);
 *
 * // Start the workers
 * service.start();
 *
 * // Systems submit work through their groups, service handles distribution
 * // ...
 *
 * // Shutdown when done
 * service.stop();
