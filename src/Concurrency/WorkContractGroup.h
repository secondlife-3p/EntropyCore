     * @brief Factory and manager for work contracts with lock-free scheduling
     * 
     * WorkContractGroup implements a work dispatcher capable of managing
     * thousands of tasks without locks or blocking operations. It provides a comprehensive
     * pool of work contracts with allocation, scheduling, and execution primitives suitable
     * for job systems, task graphs, and high-throughput work management scenarios.
     * 
     * The implementation uses SignalTree-based lock-free operations,
     * enabling multiple threads to schedule and select work concurrently without contention.
     * This design is optimized for game engines, parallel processing systems, and applications
     * requiring management of numerous small work units.
     * 
     * Key features:
     * - Lock-free contract scheduling and selection
     * - Generation-based handles prevent use-after-free bugs
     * - Immediate resource cleanup on completion
     * - Statistical monitoring (active/scheduled counts)
     * - Wait functionality for synchronization points
     * 
     * Important: This class provides scheduling primitives without handling parallel
     * execution directly. External executors such as WorkService are required for
     * concurrent work processing. The class functions as a centralized work registry
     * where tasks are posted and claimed by worker threads.
     * 
     * @code
     * // Complete workflow: mixed execution with worker service
     * WorkContractGroup group(1024);
     * WorkService service(4);  // 4 worker threads
     * service.addWorkContractGroup(&group);
     * service.start();
     * 
     * // Submit background work
     * std::vector<WorkContractHandle> handles;
     * for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
     *     auto handle = group.createContract([i]() { 
     *         processData(i); 
     *     });
     *     handle.schedule();
     *     handles.push_back(handle);
     * }
     * 
     * // Submit main thread work
     * auto uiHandle = group.createContract([]() { 
     *     updateProgressBar(); 
     * }, ExecutionType::MainThread);
     * uiHandle.schedule();
     * 
     * // Main thread pumps its work
     * while (group.hasMainThreadWork()) {
     *     group.executeMainThreadWork(5);  // Process up to 5 per frame
     *     renderFrame();
     * }
     * 
     * // Wait for all background work to complete
     * group.wait();
     * service.stop();
