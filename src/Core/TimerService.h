/**
 * @brief Service for managing timers with WorkGraph backing
 *
 * TimerService provides NSTimer-style delayed execution integrated with the
 * EntropyEngine service architecture. All timers are backed by yieldable
 * WorkGraph nodes, allowing efficient scheduling without dedicated timer threads.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - One-shot and repeating timers
 * - Main thread or background execution
 * - Automatic integration with WorkService
 * - No polling overhead - uses yieldable nodes
 * - RAII-safe timer management
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Registered with ServiceRegistry during application startup
 * - Depends on WorkService for execution
 * - Main thread timers execute via WorkService::executeMainThreadWork()
 * - Background timers execute on worker threads
 *
 * Perfect for:
 * - Delayed UI updates
 * - Periodic polling
 * - Timeout handling
 * - Animation timing
 * - Retry logic
 *
 * @code
 * // In EntropyApplication setup
 * auto timerService = std::make_shared<TimerService>();
 * services.registerService<TimerService>(timerService);
 *
 * // Later, from any system
 * auto& timers = app.getServices().get<TimerService>();
 *
 * // One-shot timer
 * auto timer = timers->scheduleTimer(
 *     std::chrono::seconds(5),
 *     []{ LOG_INFO("5 seconds elapsed"); }
 * );
 *
 * // Repeating timer on main thread
 * auto frameTimer = timers->scheduleTimer(
 *     std::chrono::milliseconds(16),
 *     []{ updateFrame(); },
 *     true,  // Repeating
 *     ExecutionType::MainThread
 * );
 *
 * // Cancel timer early
 * frameTimer.invalidate();
 * @endcode
